he file that we talked about earlier is called ".represents.kbpf", which resides in the ".represents" folder. When you're writing a timestamp to the analytics file, add another attribute to the data called "projectName". Just check for the "active" property in the .represents.kbpf file. Use the CurioKulBooks class in the "dsionRepresent" project to read the .represents.kbpf file.
